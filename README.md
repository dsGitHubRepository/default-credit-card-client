## Project Overview

The following data set stored on UCI Machine Learning Repository System  
  o Default of credit card clients 
  

## Project I

Default of credit card clients data set consists of 24 attributes such as clients six-month pay records e.g.; whether month-to-month bill was paid on time or not, whether the pay amount was full or partial comparing to the bill amount and clients other attributes such as age, sex, marriage, education and credit card (CC) balance.  


## Project I Review and Results 

We found the ratio of the number of clients who paid bill on time varies from month to month (mostly increases). However this trend varies in terms of clients attributes such as education, marriage, etc. As for example, university and grad students show better trend comparing to HS students. Single pay trend is slightly better than married. 

Inferential statistical analysis shows that the 95% confidence interval of clients balance with respect to the mean is very close to two times the STD. We applied several Machine Learning algorithms to make predictions whether a customer will be a default or not default, and compared their performance using classification report and ROC score.
